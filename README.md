# Factors Affected the Number of Titanic's Survivals

Since this project was part of the requirements to complete the Data Analysis Process provided by Udacity, the main focus was on the process of data analysis. Therefore, there could be some redundancy or deficiency at some points of the project. With that being said, my initial interest was to see whether the number of survivals was affected by any factors (variables) in the dataset.<br>

After exploring the dataset, I was interested to see the effect of two variables, `Gender` and `Pclass` on the survivals. 


The dataset `titanic-data.csv` was provided by the instructure which was originally obtained from [kaggle](<https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data>).<br>
